Currently working on R analysis for solo tracking
Trying to clean up the data, some videos are ambiguous
  solo_g_sex_20_trim.mp4 - find out what sex
  solo_g_m_16-2_trim.predictions.000_solo_g_m_16-2_trim.analysis.h5 What does that mean?
  rerun the python script to update CSV file
Make a R script that uses metadata from the naming of the file to seperate the different treatments
